## 🕊️ About WhisperBook

WhisperBook is a soft, cinematic, and emotionally safe writing platform designed for shy, quiet, and deep-feeling individuals who want to express their stories — whether privately or publicly.  

It was created out of a personal need: a peaceful place to write freely, without judgment or noise. If you've ever felt like your words didn’t belong anywhere, they belong here.

## 💡 Inspiration Behind the Project

This project was born from a deep emotional space — where sometimes we feel unheard, unseen, or too "quiet" for the world. WhisperBook is for those who journal alone, write poetry in their notes app, or dream of sharing but never felt safe to start.

> If you're that person, this space was made for you. Welcome home.
